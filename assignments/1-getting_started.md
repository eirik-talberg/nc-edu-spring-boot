# 1) Getting started
## Getting the code
First, you must clone this project, you can use the following command (from GitHub): 

`git clone git@github.com:eirik-talberg/nc-edu-spring-boot.git`

## Compiling and building the project
Not a lot is going to work until we compile and build the code. You can do this by running:

`mvn clean install`

In the root directory of the project.

## Running the application
Navigate to the starter class `no.netcompany.edu.springboot.SpringbootApplication`.

A small green arrow should appear on the left part of the editor window, press that to run the application.

## Running tests
If you want to run all the tests for the entire project: `mvn clean test verify`

If you want to run only the tests for a single class, there will be a green arrow to run one or all the tests in the 
class when you edit it.
