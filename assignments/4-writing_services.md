# 4) Writing services
Our services will reside between the controller layer and and the repository layer. It will be used
whenever we want to interact with any object in the repository. Its responsibility is to provide
a clean interface for the various controllers to access and use. A function is the service layer should
(much like any other function) have a clear descriptor of what it does.

## Complete the Pet service layer
Look at the functions of the Pet API. What service layer functions do we need? Write some functions 
to support the operations described by the API. 

Remember to also write unit tests! They will help you root out bugs and map out the correct behavior. 
Is you function very difficult to test? Maybe you should rethink how it is designed.
